## Installation
Windmill container can be deployed using 3 files: docker-compose.yml, Caddyfile and a .env
1. Create a .env file based on .env.sample, and set the POSTGRES_PASSWORD and POSTGRES_DB values. These values are referenced in docker-compose.yml.
2. Under the windmill_worker on the docker-compose.yml, create a volume to map the wip drive so that the windmill could access wip. 
e.g.,
 - /home/vm_account/wip:/data/wip
 - /home/vm_account/ocr:/data/ocr
3. To build a windmill_container by:
```
docker compose up -d 
```
